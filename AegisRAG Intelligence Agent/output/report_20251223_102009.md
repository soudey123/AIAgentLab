### Answer
Based on the provided context, biomedical/health-related RAG question-answering systems are being evaluated using a mix of **domain-specific QA datasets and task benchmarks**, **human/expert judgment against authoritative references**, and **specialized clinical factuality/validity metrics**.

Key evaluation approaches include:
- **Benchmarking on curated medical QA datasets** designed specifically to test different RAG pipeline complexities (e.g., basic vs multi-vector vs graph-enhanced RAG) and different difficulty levels of medical knowledge questions [1].
- **Task-specific QA experiments in clinical subdomains** (e.g., radiology) where a RAG system answers questions grounded in a reference source (like a textbook), and performance is compared to baselines (reported as moderate improvement in a preliminary naive RAG setup) [2].
- **Grounded correctness/completeness evaluation against authoritative documents**, including expert comparison: a custom RAG system (Raven) was evaluated on 103 synthetic laboratory regulatory questions using the CFR as the authoritative source, with a board-certified pathologist’s answers used as a reference; responses were rated for completeness/correctness, and errors were analyzed (often attributed to retrieval faults) [4].
- **Use of standard and clinical-specific metrics** emphasized in reviews, including **FactScore**, **RadGraph-F1**, and **MED-F1**, to capture factual accuracy, medical validity, and clinical relevance beyond generic NLP metrics [5].

### Evidence
- A dedicated evaluation dataset (RAGCare-QA) was created for assessing RAG pipelines using 420 theoretical medical questions across specialties and difficulty levels, and it explicitly tags questions by the “best fit” RAG complexity level (basic, multi-vector, graph-enhanced), enabling structured evaluation of retrieval/generation designs [1].
- Radiology QA evaluation described a preliminary experiment using a naive RAG with a textbook reference, reporting moderate improvements over baselines and discussing lessons learned for enhancement [2].
- Raven (a RAG system for laboratory regulatory QA) was evaluated by checking whether answers were “totally complete and correct” versus a board-certified pathologist’s manual answers for questions addressed in the authoritative CFR; it achieved 92% on those in-scope questions, with performance dropping for out-of-scope questions—evidence of grounding and an evaluation lens focused on correctness, completeness, and error source (retrieval vs hallucination) [4].
- A review of RAG in clinical domains compares evaluation strategies and highlights the use of both standard metrics and clinical-specific metrics such as FactScore, RadGraph-F1, and MED-F1, framed as critical for factual accuracy and clinical relevance [5].

### What’s missing / Unknowns
- **Biomedical engineering–specific evaluation** (as distinct from medical education, radiology, lab regulation, or general clinical QA) is not directly described in the context. The materials focus on *biomedical/clinical* domains, not engineering-focused question sets or benchmarks.
- The context does not specify **which “standard metrics”** are most commonly used (e.g., exact match, F1, ROUGE) or how they are operationalized in the cited studies [5].
- Details on **evaluation protocols** (inter-rater reliability, scoring rubrics, retrieval evaluation metrics like recall/precision@k, latency measurement procedures) are not provided beyond high-level mentions (e.g., correctness/completeness judgments; latency as a concern) [3][4][5].
